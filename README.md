# Outcast
This is a gameplay remake of JK2 that I started to build with Unreal Engine, but never followed through to the end. The assets from the Unreal marketplace are missing. If you want to download and build this you will need Feline Warrior from the marketplace or you will have to exchange those assets with your own.

[You can see a demo here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eprx1IPxsDc) The FPS drops are the result of my laptop being too weak to record simultaneously while playing.

I mostly focused on building up basic network capabilities, like client side interpolation and prediction to cope with network lag, as well as some basic animations and hit detection.

If you have a friend and use hamachi you can actually play together. Unreal Engine unfortunately only supports LAN connections out of the box. For anything else there is some (mild) extra work to be done which I never came to.
